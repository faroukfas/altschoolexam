      <h2> ABOUT THE PROJECT</h2>
      <p>
        This project involves hosting a website on an Ubuntu server using Apache, configuring the server to serve the 
        website's HTML and CSS files, associating a free domain name or subdomain with the server, and securing the site 
        with HTTPS using Certbot. The setup required resolving issues like file listing, permissions, and Apache configurations, 
        showcasing expertise in web hosting, Linux server management, and basic security practices</p>
      <p>Also: This project also includes creating an EC2 instance on AWS to serve as the Ubuntu server for hosting the website. 
        The EC2 instance was set up using the Ubuntu operating system, providing a scalable and reliable environment for web hosting.</p>

      <h2>MY GOAL AT ALTSHOOL</h2>
      <p>Cloud Engineering is a field that has rapidly grown in importance as businesses increasingly rely on cloud
        infrastructure to store data, run applications, and manage their operations. I chose this course because I
        recognize the transformative power of cloud technologies and their ability to drive efficiency, scalability, and
        innovation across various sectors. By gaining expertise in cloud engineering, I aim to contribute to the
        development and implementation of cloud solutions that can help organizations harness the full potential of this
        technology.</p>
      <p>At AltSchool Africa, I am not just learning the technical aspects of cloud engineering but also developing
        critical problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of how to architect, deploy, and manage cloud
        solutions. The curriculum is designed to be immersive and up-to-date with industry standards, ensuring that I am
        learning the most relevant and in-demand skills.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, being part of a vibrant community of like-minded individuals and experienced instructors at AltSchool
        Africa has enriched my learning experience. The collaborative environment encourages continuous learning and
        growth, helping me to stay motivated and focused on my goals.
      </p>
      <p>In conclusion, This project has exposed me to my weakness and strength and I have learnt to resolve and troubleshoot 
        technical issues while working on my project which has better prepared me for what the future hold.</p>
