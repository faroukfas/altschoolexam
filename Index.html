        critical problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of how to architect, deploy, and manage cloud
        solutions. The curriculum is designed to be immersive and up-to-date with industry standards, ensuring that I am
        learning the most relevant and in-demand skills.

        Africa has enriched my learning experience. The collaborative environment encourages continuous learning and
